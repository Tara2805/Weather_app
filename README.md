#API KEYS#
It is used for authentication when making requests to the OpenWeatherMap API
In order to set up an API key you must first navigate to the APIs website and sign up
weatherAPI sign up = https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_in
Once signed up we can see, copy and generate API keys
Enter the key that was sent to you in the variable "api_key"

api_key is used as a parameter in the URL when making a request to the OpenWeatherMap API
Do not publically share your API keys, this can be a security risk to your sensitive data
